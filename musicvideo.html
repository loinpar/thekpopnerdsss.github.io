         <h4>MUSIC VIDEOS</h4>
         <p> And here we have some of our personal picks of our favourite kpop music videos in recent time and we firmly believe that these
         music videos require more attention and love from the fans.</p>
        <p> Here we have DREAMCATCHER's BOCA from the album Dysyopia:Lose Myself. The imagery of the track, the album's underlying theme and the sounds of the music give off a vibe to fight back an issue that has couded the kpop industry in recent times.
          Of course we are talking about kpop idols being abused and pushed into stressed and ultimately into suicide. The song firmly states that we should speak up to defend ourselves. Well we won't continue to blabber and flabber all of you. Enjoy the music video!
                         MORE MUSIC VIDEOS COMING SOON</p>
