        <p>Here we have the review page, where we give in depth reviews on music videos by released by artists and even their albums. The difference betwween the review page and the music videos page is that reviews give a more detailed look at the song.
        Well without further ado LESGETIT!</p>

        <p>Here we have is arguably my favourite song of this year. With the comeback of NCT 2020 with their album <a href='https://smglobalshop.com/products/pre-order-nct-2020-resonance-pt-1-the-future-ver'>RESONANCE: PART 1</a>
        . The long awaited collaboration between all of NCT's sub-units the Korean-Based unit NCT 127, the Chinese-Based unit WayV and their baby unit NCT DREAM plus two new members SHOTARO and SUNGCHAN. In their title track (as shown above) MAKE A WISH is an amazing song
        that incorporates whistling sounds and electronic percussions to create a unique sound that is familiar to fans of NCT or as they are called NCTzens. The sub-unit that is created from the line-up of NCT consists of TAEYONG, JAEHYUN and DOYOUNG from NCT 127,
       XIAOJUN and LUCAS from WAYV, JAEMIN from NCT DREAM and the new Japanese member SHOTARO. The overall aesthetic of the music video is *chef's kiss*. Obviously we can see that it takes heavy inspiration from Turkish architecture with its chandelier and genie-like lyrics
      (You know... Make A Wish hahahaha). The visuals of each individual members are show stopping and all of them shine in brightly in their own style. Not to mention the long awaited coalition between the vocals of DOYOUNG and XIAOJUN from fans. And what we got is exactly what we wanted, a beautiful harmonization between those two.
       Let us also commend the new member SHOTARO for his powerful debut. Being able to stand out especially being in the same unit as TAEYONG and LUCAS is amazing. He could be said to be as the next TAEYONG with his dancing skills showing great potential.
      The choreography is also unique as expected from NCT, from constant formation changes, knee breaking movements and sexy body rolls, NCT never disappoints in their choreography. I will master that leg dance move at the end mark my words. Overall the title track is aesthetically pleasing and culturally significant
      as NCT shows that art needs to be continuously revised and reimagined into new forms. It is a great song and even if you don't enjoy kpop I ensure you will like this song. I cannot wait to see what NCT 2020 has to offer in the future and beyond.</p>
