          <h2>LOONA HEEJIN's BEAUTY CAUSED AN UPROAR AMONG FANS</h2>
          <p>
            Both K-Netizens (Korean Fans) and international fans alike are stunned by LOONA Heejin's beauty after LOONA's recent comeback with their new album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6li05zh3Kg" target="blank_">12:00</a> and some of their fans even compare her looks to BLACKPINK's JISOO and RED VELVET's IRENE. While some fans might think this comparison is just a fun thing to do when comparing visually stunning idols but this seemingly
            harmless comparison has led to fan wars between multiple different fandoms. Some fans even claim that LOONA fans are calling their favourite idols ugly and this misunderstanding has led to fans even sending death threats to both unrelated LOONA members and their fans alike. Even though this might sound funny at the surface, but this situation might spiral out of control when someone actually gets hurt. In conclusion, we must not get too worked
            up and get aggresive when it comes to k-pop. At the end of the day it is only for entertainment purposes and all comparisons are just simply fun rivalries that fans like to create to spice up their hobby. MORE NEWS COMING SOON
